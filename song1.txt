Moon river
wider than a mile,
I'm crossing you in style some day.
Old dream maker, you, heart breaker,
Wherever you're going I'm going your way.

Two drifters off to see the world;
There's such a lot of world to see.
We're after the same rainbow's end, 1
Waiting 'round the bend,
My huckleberry friend,
Moon river and me.
